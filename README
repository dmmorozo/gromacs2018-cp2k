There how to use that version.

NOTE: it only works without MPI and/or threading for now

1) Build SOPT (single-processor optimized) version of CP2K for your system 
  Follow the CP2K build procedure. After that use:

   make ARCH=XXX VERSION=YYY -jZZZ libcp2k 

   it should produce libcp2k.a in the <PATH TO your cp2k directory>/lib/XXX/YYY

2) Build Gromacs. I've compiled it with the following staff:

cmake .. -DGMX_MPI=off -DGMX_DOUBLE=on -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-I<PATH TO your cp2k directory>/src/start" -DGMX_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-L<path to directory with full cp2k lib> -lcp2k -ldbcsr(needed for libcp2k) -lstdc++ -ldl -lz" -DGMX_QMMM_PROGRAM=gaussian

In addition, I would strongly recomend to use external BLAS and LAPACK 
and enforce them to be exatly the same as the one used to compile the CP2K

3) Test case system for that version is located in the /tests/cp2k directory
You could run it with something like:

gmx mdrun -nt 1 -ntomp 1 -v -s topol.tpr

4) All interface routines are located on the place of Gaussian one in the qm-gaussian.cpp
There are also modifications to qmmm.cpp has been done to ensure that the whole mdatoms (which are not QM) are in the MMatoms record.
